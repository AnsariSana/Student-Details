            <p>Bikram nominated to the CAP India Advisory Board</p>
            <p>Bikram Chaudhury has been nominated to the CAP India Advisory Board of the Climate Action Platform (CAP). CAP aims to bring the power of a 100 million individual users together to create targeted pressure for corporate action on climate change. CAP's online platform and app will combine social media, big data, and artificial intelligence to pool their economic and political power, at unprecedented scale, to influence corporate and governmental leaders across the world.</p>
            <p>“CAP is truly inspirational in its vision and scale and I am honoured to assist CAP on its journey from a startup to a true-scale platform that will make a material difference for our world. I have been supporting CAP as the team navigates the Asian context, drawing on my background in impact investing in India, South Asia, and China. In particular, we have studied Alibaba’s AntForest with the CAP team and believe we can build similar models of incentivization and tangible impact into CAP’s user experience. We plan to link the CAP to a pipeline of reforestation projects in India, extending the financial mechanisms we have co-developed for ecosystem restoration in Asia to the India context. Through this partnership, we aim to deliver market returns along with benefits on the ground for climate, communities and biodiversity.” </p>
